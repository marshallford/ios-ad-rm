WHAT IS IT?
Ad Rm is a small unix script run from SSH or Terminal on a Jailbroken iDevice.
It provides a basic GUI for users that wish to remove ads from their system.

Works with:
-Installous
-Google Ads
- Flashy Banners
- Malicious sites
- Spam sites
- Large and obtrusive ads

NEWS:
Do not be alarmed at the warning message ==> Required by Bigboss, just thought I'd keep it for now.

AUTHOR NOTE:
I finished my first Cydia app called AdRm ( Ad remover ) and I am looking for people to continue developing the project with me.
